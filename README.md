Documentation for the liquibase.org site.

Please send pull requests!

The Liquibase site is hosted using GitHub Pages, and generated using 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Pages are written in MarkDown documents, making
use of [Liquid template tags](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/).

To build the site for local testing, install Jekyll and its dependencies, 
including Ruby, the kramdown gem, Python 2.7, and the Pygments package. If 
you're developing on Windows, there is a handy [Portable package of Jekyll](
https://github.com/madhur/PortableJekyll) you can use.
You may still need to fiddle around a bit to get it working, such as installing
the kramdown gem ("gem install kramdown") and editing "setpath.cmd".

Once Jekyll is installed, just navigate to this repo's directory, and run
`jekyll serve`. You can then access the site from `http://localhost:4000`.

If you're using a MarkDown editor with a "live preview" feature, be aware that
it's unlikely to support Liquid's syntax highlighting tags, such as 
"{% highlight xml %}".
